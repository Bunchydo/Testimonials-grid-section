                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

              I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
              had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
              life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
              careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

              <span>Before joining the bootcamp, I've <br> never written a line of code. I
              needed <br>some structure from professionals <br> who can help me learn
              programming <br>to step by step. I was encouraged to <br>enroll by a former
              student of theirs <br>who can only say wonderful things <br>about the
              program. The entire <br>curriculum and staff did not <br>disappoint. They
              were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br>assistance.
              The agile team project, in <br>particular,br was outstanding. It took <br>my
              learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial could ever
              have. In fact, I've often referred to it during <br> interviews as an
              example of my <br> development experience. It certainly <br>helped me land
              a job as a full-stack <br>developer after receiving multiple <br> offers.
              100% recommend!</span>

                Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
                themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their
                experiences was easy.

              The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
              really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to
              be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
              junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
              personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart
              and amazing people.
